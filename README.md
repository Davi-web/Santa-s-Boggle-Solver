# Santa's Boggle Solver
Implementation of the Boggle Solver using Tries and Trienodes for optimization. 
The file "words.txt" contains words from the official scrabble player's dictionary. 
We use a stack to implement a Depth First Traversal through all the neighboring 
points on the boggle board to find valid words from the dictionary. This boggle 
board works for any M x M board.

    The dictionary will either hold valid words that's at least 3 or 4 letters long
    depending on what the user inputs as the size of the boggle board. The regular 
    game Boggle is a 4x4 grid and words must be at least three letters long. Big 
    Boggle is a 5x5 grid and words must be at least four letters long. For this program,
    I made it so that the program will be able to handle any M x M board where M > 1.
